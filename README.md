# tea

**tea_editor_ante** â€” a lightweight terminal text editor for real coders.

## project description

a minimal terminal-based text editor written in c++,  
with vim-style navigation (`hjkl`).  

designed for simplicity, speed, and staying close to the metal.

>	*real coder won't die*

## features

- terminal raw mode
- vim-style movement (`hjkl`)
- simple command mode (`esc` `:wq`, `:q!`)
- clean screen redraw
- no external dependencies

## installation / build

```bash
g++ -o tea tea.cpp -std=c++14 -O2 -static -w
./tea
```

## usage

`h` `j` `k` `l` - move the cursor

`esc :wq` - exit (like vim, but no saving yet)

`esc :q!` - force quit without saving

editing functionality will be added later.

## contributing

wait for me to finish reading *the art of computer programming*.  
then I might rewrite everything.
